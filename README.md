# Design Decisions for the Layout

## üü¶ **Color Scheme:**
- **Primary Colors:** Blue, black, and white ‚Äî blue highlights key elements (like buttons and pricing) to draw attention, while black and white create a clean, modern contrast.
- **Backgrounds:** The black background in the "Features" and "Contact Us" sections adds depth, helping the white text and blue icons pop. The gradient effect in the contact section adds a polished touch.

## ‚úçÔ∏è **Typography:**
- **Font Family:** `'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif` ‚Äî a modern, clean, and highly legible font choice that complements the tech-savvy vibe of a web design service.
- **Font Sizes & Weights:** Headings are bold and prominent to establish hierarchy, while body text remains smaller and lighter for readability.

## üìê **Layout Choices:**
- **Hero Section:** Split layout with text on the left and visuals on the right ‚Äî this helps communicate value quickly while showcasing the product.
- **Features Section:** Three-column layout for balance and symmetry, with icons and concise descriptions for scannability.
- **Pricing Section:** A classic three-tier pricing model with distinct cards, where the "Pro" plan is highlighted with a blue background to encourage selection.
- **Contact Section:** Simple form layout with generous padding and a centered design to make it approachable and easy to fill out.

## üü† **UI/UX Considerations:**
- **Button Styles:** Clear, contrasting buttons with simple, directive text ("Get started," "Sign up for free") guide the user naturally through the flow.
- **Spacing & Padding:** Ample spacing between sections to prevent visual clutter and ensure content is easy to digest.

This design is geared toward simplicity, readability, and conversion ‚Äî the color and layout choices create a professional, trustworthy feel while emphasizing action points.
